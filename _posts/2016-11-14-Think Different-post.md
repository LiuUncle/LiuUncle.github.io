如果连相信都不曾有过，更别提去做成什么事情。

许多人曾问我，为什么要做产品经理。我也同样不断的反复问自己。反复回答自己。

我想引用这则 Apple 在1997年的广告，去回答所有人，也包括自己的质疑



> Here's to the crazy ones.
> The misfits.
> The rebels.
> The troublemakers.
> The round pegs in the square holes.
> The ones who see things differently.
> They're not fond of rules
> And they have no respect for the status quo.
>
> 
> You can praise them, quote them, disagree with them
> disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.
> About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.
> Because they change things.
> They invent.     They imagine.     They heal.
> They explore.   They create.        They inspire.
> They push the human race forward.
>
> 
> Maybe they have to be crazy.
> How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?
> Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?
> Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
> We make tools for these kinds of people.
> While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
>

> Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can

**一个人如果连相信自己可以改变世界的能力都没有，还拿什么去改变世界？**

The people who are crazy enough to think that they can
change the world, are the ones who do.



我是杨柳，一个疯狂到认为自己能改变世界的男人。

如果你也想改变世界，来跟着我一起疯狂吧。

Change the world
